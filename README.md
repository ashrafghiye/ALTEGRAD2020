# Problem Description
 - - - -

The goal of this project is to study and apply machine learning techniques to a real-world regression problem. In this regression problem, each sample corresponds to a researcher, i.e. an author of research papers, and the goal is to build a model that can predict accurately the h-index of each author. 
To build the model, we have access to two types of data: 

1. **Collaboration Graph** that models the collaboration intensity of two researchers: i.e. whether they have co-authored any papers.
2. **Abstracts** of the top-cited papers for each author.


# Motivation

Scientific success can be quantified with many measures, maybe the famoust of them all is the h-index introduced by Hirsch in 2005. The h-index measures the author productivity and the citation impact of his/her publications. It is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author has published h papers that have each been cited at least h times.
